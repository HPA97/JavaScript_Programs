This is a Random/Procedural Map Generator that uses several tricks and simple modifications to make a seemingly realistic/immersive 2d tiled map. It uses simple tile analysis combined with some randomness. You can always make it more complex, and end up with something that might even be better than the usual map/procedural map generation techniques. I'm not sure how prevailant this kind of technique is, but i'd like to name it improvisative based world generation, using "Good enough" techinques/alghoritms.

This mini project contains a html file, css file and several javascript files as well as Sprites folder containig a gif with the several tiles that is used in this project. 

Feel free to use/modify it.
